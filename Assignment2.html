        <p class="block1">
            The Earth's oceans are all connected to one another.
            Until the year 2000, there were four recognized oceans: the Pacific,
            Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic. In the Spring of 2000,
            the International Hydrographic Organization delimited a new ocean,
            the Southern Ocean (it surrounds Antarctica and extends to 60 degrees latitude).
            There are also many seas (smaller branches of an ocean);
            seas are often partly enclosed by land. The largest seas are the South China Sea,
            the Caribbean Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.
